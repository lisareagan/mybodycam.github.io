MyBodyCam Safety Circle SMS Invitations

MyBodyCam is a personal safety application that allows users to invite trusted family members or friends (“Safety Circle members”) to view a live safety session.

SMS messages are sent only when a MyBodyCam user manually enters a phone number and confirms they have permission to contact that person.

Safety Circle members:

Do not subscribe to marketing messages

Do not receive recurring promotional communications

Do not provide their phone number to MyBodyCam directly

Messages are limited to:

A one-time Safety Circle invitation, and

Optional live safety session notifications initiated by the MyBodyCam user

Safety Circle SMS messages are transactional and safety-related, not marketing.

Recipients may ignore the message or reply STOP to opt out of future messages.
